Privacy Policy for KeyForge

Last updated: 09/10/2024

KeyForge is a simple and intuitive application to generate passwords on desktop, developed by Josh Birch. This privacy policy is to inform users that:

  1. Data Collection: KeyForge does not collect, store, or transmit any personal data or user information.

  2. Functionality: The app operates entirely on the user's device and generates passwords based solely on an internal algorithm.

  3. Internet Connectivity: KeyForge does not connect to the internet or any external servers.

  4. Data Storage: No user data, including password input or analysis results, is stored beyond the current session. All information is discarded when the app is closed, except for the information copied to clipboard.

  5. Third-Party Services: The app does not use any third-party services or analytics tools.

  6. Security: Since KeyForge operates offline and does not store any data, your generated passwords remain private and secure from within the app.

  7. Updates: If there are any changes to our data handling practices in future versions, this privacy policy will be updated accordingly.
