### KeyForge: Generate unbreakable passwords ###

A simple and intuitive application to generate passwords on desktop. Built with Python, KeyForge makes sure the password that it generates for you is virtually uncrackable and completely random with high entropy. 

# Features

    - **Quick and Simple**: A streamlined design with a quick response ensures you can get a randomly generated password at a tap.
    - **Comprehensive**: All passwords generated are 18 characters in length, and your new password is then checked against the highest standards to ensure a password with high entropy.
    - **Offline Functionality**: Works without internet, making your data completely safe and making the app available to use at any point.
    - **No Data Collection or Storage**: The app does not collect or transmit any of your data, and the passwords generated are displayed as text only on your local machine.


# Installation

Requirements:

    - Python 3.7 or higher.
    - TKinter (usually included with Python).
